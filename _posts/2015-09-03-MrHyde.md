So during the trip I'll be blogging to this Jekyll blog. I will use the app MrHyde, and while testing it now, I must say I like it.

Writing is clean and simple, and so is publishing. 

Before today you couldn't commit to branches other than `master`, But I helped in fixing it, thanks to it being open source.
