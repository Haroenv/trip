Yesterday evening I walked a little tour of the small village Orgeo, and talked there to some locals, wondering what I could do today with the extra time.

Then I found out that the *Abbaye d'Orval* was only a small detour.

The road to here was a quite nice ride, taking secondary roads. The only disadvantage is that cars ride at 90km/h here, so once in a while you are taken over by them.

I am now at the caf√© owned by the abbey, and taking a break, with of course an Orval. 

Cheers!
