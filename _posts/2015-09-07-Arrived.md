After that break I finished the last bit of that hill, and soon after that I encountered a pleasant descent. At the end of that there was a speed checker for cars, at which point I was going at 50km/h. A little after that it started drizzling, but it stopped soon.

Then my route went through a windmill-park. I don't think that I've been so close to those before (2m).

At the end it was a bit of a search because the names of the streets here are written in black on grey, so finding the street was a small challenge.

The house I'm in is one of an old lady, who also rents this as a regular *g√Æte*. 

Now I'm going to rest a bit, and then I'll probably go look at the castle of Beloeil (5km from here).
