I'm writing from Waregem now. just after I accidentally went straight where I had to go left, I decided that I should stop at Waregem. Not because I am tired, but because this was where I expected to take my lunch break.

Funnily enough I've been advancing faster than prepared, so I'll stay here for 2 hours and then lunch. The reason I do this is because I won't pass another city today, and I feel like having spaghetti.

I've also posted on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/haroenv), so you can follow that too.

Bye

Edit: spaghetti became pizza
