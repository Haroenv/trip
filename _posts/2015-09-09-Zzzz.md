I woke up a bit later than planned today, but luckily my etappe today is 67km (4h30 according to Maps).

The first bit seems to be very steep, because it wants me to go through each village possible apparently.

In a way, that is lucky, because I need to buy new bread and stuff to put on the bread.

Tonight the host has prepared a dinner for me, so I'll have to really try not to have too much delay.

I'm gonna finish my breakfast in this totally pinewood gîte, and then I'm off!
