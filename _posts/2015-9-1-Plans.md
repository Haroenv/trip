My plan is to travel during about a week through Belgium, I'll try to bike from Bruges to Arlon, and then take the train back.

Initial plan:

This will take me throught Kortrijk, Tournai, Mons, Philippeville, Libin and finally Arlon.

I'm planning to do this during the next week, from Monday 7 September to Thursday 10 September.

I wish myself good luck!
